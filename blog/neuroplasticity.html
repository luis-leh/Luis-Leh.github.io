      <h1>The Principles of Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Use it or lose it</li>
          <li>Use it and improve it</li>
          <li>Specificity</li>
          <li>Repetition Matters</li>
          <li>Intensity Matters</li>
          <li>Time Matters</li>
          <li>Salience Matters</li>
          <li>Age Matters</li>
          <li>Transference</li>
          <li>Interference</li>

    <div class="main-content" style="position: relative; top: 80px;">
        <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity help people in realizing that their brains are not fixed in its 
          function and that it has the opportunity to grow and improve with the proper process and mindset. 
          This would give them the power to learn new things or to improve and develop on what is important to them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content" style="position: relative; top: 120px;">
        <ol>
          <li>Use it or lose it - I will need to give time to practice physically and mentally, the abilities that are important to me so that I am able to keep them</li>
          <li>Use it and improve it - The brain is a powerful thing and if you think you can't do it, you won't be able to. If I want to learn something new or improve something I am not good at, I need to consistently try and believe to be able to achieve something</li>
          <li>Specificity - Although general practice is beneficial, targeting the specific skill and focusing on it would greatly improve the efficacy of the effort. When I want to improve on something, I should break it down in parts if possible and then deal with them one by one</li>
          <li>Repetition matters - This is something that everyone would have heard of before which is the same as “practice makes perfect” or “practice makes permanent”. I have know this concept for a long time, especially in sports and video games so I would just need to incorporate it into this new undertaking</li>
          <li>Intensity matters - Putting effort in is good but the more effort is put in, the likelihood of better results are, so I need to keep this in mind.</li>
          <li>Time matters - Plasticity happens at different times and although this won't be the same for the whole period, we need to try and get good habits in earlier than develop bad habits and deal with them later.</li>
          <li>Salience matters - To induce plasticity, the experience must be important so that it would hold a certain gravity to the person. The best way to do this is to understand something and relate it with something to give it a sense of importance in order to strengthen plasticity.</li>
          <li>Age matters - Younger brains are more adaptable than older brains. This idea should be kept in mind when working with both groups. I am somewhere in the middle as I am not so young and not so old but I believe that extra effort would be needed for me to adapt better.</li>
          <li>Transference - How to relate things in the real world or the day-to-day lives of people would significantly aid in plasticity. This view is something that I am trying to do in all aspects of life and I would also incorporate it in my learning journey.</li>
          <li>Interference - “Unlearning” to learn and to start clean could be necessary for us to achieve our goals in plasticity. I would need to be open-minded and learn how to start fresh.</li>

      <h1>The Growth Mindset</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that focuses on the positives when learning and provides individuals
             the understanding that if they can't do something, it is because they just can't do it YET. 
            This is extremely relevant not just to me and the students of Dev, but everyone trying to learn something in their lives. 
            This would be the complete opposite of having a Fixed Mindset which, sad to say, was the way I was taught in school growing up. 
            Learning this now empowers me with the ability to be able to learn the things in my Dev Academy journey. 
            I would be able to confidently say to myself if I'm not able to do something, NOT YET.</p>

      <h1>Blending with my Learning Plan & Strategies</h1>
        <p>Coming off from Sprint-3 and experiencing a lot of challenging moments, I realize how having a Growth Mindset becomes a very important part in learning and in life. 
          For me, during this Dev Academy Aotearoa experience and the future that lies ahead of me. 
          For some of us studying with Dev Academy, what we are doing is basically learning a new language. 
          It is not easy and it is actually very difficult at times but, this is a good way for us to rewire our brains and practice neuroplasticity. 
          Approaching foundation and bootcamp with a Growth Mindset and believing that everything we do constantly improves us will definitely be an 
          important part of the journey and something that will be helpful to keep us motivated until the end.</p>
