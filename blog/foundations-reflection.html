      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </h2>
        <p>
          The three new things that i have learnt about myself and my ego during the Core learning are:
          <ol>
            <li>I am able to learn new and difficult things even if it takes me longer than everybody else as long as I keep at it</li>
            <li>I still have a long way to go to be able to feel comfortable with coding JavaScript as I wasn't able to do well during the challenges</li>
            <li>I was encouraged by the idea of neuroplasticity, growth mindset, just-in-time learning, and the “not yet” attitude.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

    <div class="main-content" style="position: relative; top: 80px;">
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          Values are important in programming as it is what a person is built of. 
          These values tend to show when you are under pressure and facing difficult situations. 
          If you have either good or bad, it would greatly affect how you will be facing life and all its aspects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Empathy is another important value in programming as it is the ability to
           relate and understand with the people you work with or the people around you. 
          Understanding these people will ensure that there is respect and harmony amongst everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Self-awareness ensures that a person knows themselves first and what they are capable of,
           good at, needs improvement in, and what they need to learn and program better.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          What surprised me the most about learning core was how I found it very interesting and relatable. 
          I felt that I haven't excelled in any way with the Tech side of things 
          but I can also say that I feel very at ease with the Core learnings through Foundations.

    <div class="main-content" style="position: relative; top: 100px;">
      <h2>What were the most challengning aspects of core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I think making the Learning Plan was the most challenging part of 
          the Core learnings for me but it was still enjoyable and eye-opening.
        </p>

    <div class="main-content" style="position: relative; top: 140px;">
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that Dev Academy Aotearoa is spending a lot of time and focus on core learning 
          as this is something that came to your attention when looking at what good developers really need. Although Tech is also very important, 
          Core is something that is more difficult to learn as it is something that has developed in an individual over the years of experiences.
        </p>

    <div class="main-content" style="position: relative; top: 160px;">
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
        Shoud you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      </h2>

        <p>
          The time I have spend studying core learning maybe the most enjoyable and feel good studies I have done my whole life. 
          It has given me a lot of new perspective and realizations in life and also encouraged me a lot.
