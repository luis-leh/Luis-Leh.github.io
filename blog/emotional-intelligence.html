            It is the ability to learn, understand and apply information and skills, along with logical reasoning, word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial thinking.</p>
          
          <p>EQ on the other hand, is the ability to identify, evaluate, control and express emotions, perceive and asses the emotions of others, and use emotions to facilitate thinking. 
            There is also ways to measure EQ and it is something that greatly affects the day to day life, career, and relationship with other people.</p>

          <p>Something that people usually say is that IQ will help you be successful in school and EQ will help you become successful in life. 
            IQ is something that we are usually born with while EQ is something that develops through our experiences and encounters in life.</p>
