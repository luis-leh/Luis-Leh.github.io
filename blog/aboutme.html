      <h2>Introduce Yourself</h2>
      <p>Kia ora koutou! My name is Luis but you can refer to me here as either that or L.A. which is my nickname. 
        Originally from the Philippines, I came to New Zealand in 2015 and have been based in the wonderful city of Otautahi Christchurch since.</p>

      <p>I have been thinking about values and identity and the thing that really draws me is the amazing collection of people that I have encountered at Dev Academy Aotearoa (Discord XD) and realize that each and everyone have their own story that would include their principles, values and identity. 
        I believe that as different as all of us here are, there is a feeling of unity and a sense of belongingness to the group. 
        Everyone seems to be so helpful, kind, positive and welcoming that it could be the best social media space there is and entirely different from all the negativity that we see around other platforms!</p>

      <p>I am attending Dev Academy Aotearoa to try and do a career change which I felt I needed after spending 7 years with a company in the healthcare industry. 
        It has been a pleasure connecting with a lot of you here and I am looking forward to our journey individually and collectively. 
        Wishing all the best to every single one of you!</p>

      <p>This kind of this usually freaks me out and it is something that I would prefer not doing at all. 
        However, the group felt friendly and welcoming enough that I was happy to give it a go. 
        Everyone having to do it also helped make it easier.</p>

      <p>Talking about ego, I thought I always knew what it meant and how to explain it but, being asked now if I could feel it, I am not entirely sure what to say. 
        I had to research and look for a clear definition of the word to figure out how to answer the question. 
        Ultimately, I am just making myself more confused with all the things I am reading online so I will stop and say that yes, I can feel my ego in a way that it pushes me to succeed in this path that I am on and the new career that I have chosen.</p>
