      <h2>That time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>
          There was a time during Sprint 2 that really threw me off. We were tasked to publish a website that was also designed by us.
          Everything was going fine with the understandable difficulty that I expected until it came to the point where we needed to publish it on GitHub.
          Suddenly, my website was not working even if it was fine locally.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first, it was very frustrating that the website I worked very hard on is not getting published. I kept on going back and forth, reading all 
          the instructions in the Dev Academy Handbook, going through my work and not finding out why this was happening. I tried Googling, The Rubber Ducky Method,
          and Trying something but to no avail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, something in my head just wondered if my naming of the files and folders was the cause of the problem. I looked at my GitHub username and files 
          and saw that I have used uppercase letters at the beginning of my files and folders. I went back to google to search if this would have a negative effect 
          on GitHub and it answered me with a resounding YES! The process gave me different feelings, some of joy, some of worry, some of panic, and some of 
          satisfaction. I learned that there are a lot of problems that would throw you off and make you feel like there is no solution to it but not giving up 
          is an important mindset that would lead us to the right direction.

      <h2>That time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
        <p>
          The problem that I faced this time was connected to the one that I had above. I solved the first problem of finding out what was wrong with my html 
          file. This time, I needed to learn how to change the file names and folder names that I have published on GitHub without needing to delete and publish 
          things again. To solve this problem, I knew that I had to turn to Google.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, I thought that it wouldn't be difficult to find the solution but to my surprise, there hasn't been that much people who encountered the 
          same problem with their files on GitHub. The solutions that I have found were in the very smallest way of being related to what I needed. 
          It took me a while to find out a solution to my specific problem. A video published on YouTube that was not very popular was the one that saved me. 
          This experienced coder was able to explain what to do very simply and concisely that it ultimately helped me get rid of my problem at that time.
        </p>

        <p>
          My learning for this part was to not give up and keep an open mind. This is very important so that we won't get discouraged as sometimes, we give up
          without knowing that we are so close to solving our problems. I also learned that lowercase was the way to go on GitHub along with no spaces for our 
          file names.
