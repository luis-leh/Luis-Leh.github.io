      <h2>That time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>
          There was a time during Sprint 2 that really threw me off. We were tasked to publish a website that was also designed by us.
          Everything was going fine with the understandable difficulty that I expected until it came to the point where we needed to publish it on GitHub.
          Suddenly, my website was not working even if it was fine locally.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first, it was very frustrating that the website I worked very hard on is not getting published. I kept on going back and forth, reading all 
          the instructions in the Dev Academy Handbook, going through my work and not finding out why this was happening. I tried Googling, The Rubber Ducky Method,
          and Trying something but to no avail.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, something in my head just wondered if my naming of the files and folders was the cause of the problem. I looked at my GitHub username and files 
          and saw that I have used uppercase letters at the beginning of my files and folders. I went back to google to search if this would have a negative effect 
          on GitHub and it answered me with a resounding YES! The process gave me different feelings, some of joy, some of worry, some of panic, and some of 
          satisfaction. I learned that there are a lot of problems that would throw you off and make you feel like there is no solution to it even if you look very hard 
          but we need to face this with an open mind and to keep on trying as all problems have a solution that we will eventually find.
