        <p>I have taken this course with the intention of learning some skills that would help me move on to a new career pathway. 
          My long term goal is to be someone who has established himself in the tech industry and have the knowledge (and continue learning) to adapt to the ever changing industry.</p>

        <h4>Learning Strengths</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Being able to find answers evnetually</li>
          <li>Motivated to learn</li>
          <li>Not giving up</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Learning Limitations</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Spend too much time looking for answers</li>
          <li>Doubting myself</li>
          <li>Embarrassed to ask for help</li>
          <li>Comparing myself to others</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I would like to be able to talk to people easily and ask questions without the fear of being judged or feeling stupid. 
          I would also like to learn how to provide criticism in a positive way and not feel bad or afraid.</p>

        <p>To manage the workload in this programme, I will give plenty of time to learn and practice everyday, completing requirements and doing extra studies to be able to cope with the course. 
          Helping other learners in ways that I can to bring everyone up and not leave anyone behind is also something that I would commit to, along with respect, kindness, honesty and openness.</p>

        <p>When things are building up and getting to me, I would take time off from the screen and have a break. 
          Doing something that may distract and relax me so that I will be able to start fresh by the time I go back to the problem.</p>

        <p>During times of needing help from others, I will seek information from other learners on Discord, while being mindful of the reality that other people also are busy
           so I should be patient and keep on trying to find the solution to my problems while waiting for the input of other people.</p>

        <p>I expect the facilitation team to be there to assist student in times of need, and to be ready to answer questions that the learners will have. 
          I also expect them to ensure that all learners are on the right path and are gaining the skills and knowledge that they are seeking to acquire when they entered the course, if not more.
        (which is what they are doing :)</p>

        <p>My block out times would be taking care of my son at different times during the day so that my wife would be able to do things that she needs to do as well. 
          This could happen at different times during the day but mostly set during meal times and in between breaks.</p>
